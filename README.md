# Machine-Learning-101
Polynomial regression with sklearn as an introduction to machine learning with python.

To follow through the example, just copy the contents of the init.py file from GitHub and execute it in
a separate file on your current PC. Make sure to run init.py in a directory where you want to store your
code, for example I would store it in the Desktop directory. Init.py will initialize a new tutorial
directory called "ml_101" with main.py and the necessary data for the example. It will delete itself after 
it has been executed on the python interpretor. Make sure numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and sklearn libraries
are installed on the environment.
